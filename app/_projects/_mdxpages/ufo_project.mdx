## About

This was my final project for ICS 369, which was made and rendered in <LinkComp src='https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview'>Maya</LinkComp>. The goal was to use Python to create and animate several particle systems in a ~30 second animation. This was achieved by using Maya's <LinkComp src='https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-55B63946-CDC9-42E5-9B6E-45EE45CFC7FC'>script editor</LinkComp> to create objects, set materials, set transforms, add keyframes, etc. For instance, the speed lines, asteroids, clouds, and trees are some of the particle systems that were made using a Python script. Other models, such as the UFO and cow, were manually created and animated.

## Experience

ICS 369 was where I used scripts to animate for the first time. I also extensively utilized classes and first-class functions in my particle system script to have customizable emitters and forces. For instance, I can set the amount of objects an emitter emits per frame, how long it will emit for, what the particle's polygon/model will be, the area that particles can spawn in, and so on.

Below is a snippet showing the emitter class and all the properties that can be set:
